Bio:
</h2>

<p>
Hello World! My name is Duaa Zaheer and I'm a senior at the International Community School in Kirkland, Washington State. I live in a small town called Redmond in the Seattle Eastside region, and I absolutely ADORE where I live. I feel too many people set a bad image for Seattle and only see it as some boring, rainy corner of the country, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Seattle is my favorite place in the world, and home to some of the world's largest technology hubs, such as Microsoft and Amazon. It's <em>literally</em> the ideal location for a person like me who loves technology and prefers mild weather, so I would definitely think twice before the next time you decide to critique Seattle.

My Family and Background:
</h2>

<p>
I live with my mom, dad, and 2 younger sisters. My parents are from a town in Pakistan called Rawalpindi, and moved to New Jersey in 2000. I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on April 6th of 2001, but moved to Redmond, Washington State only 9 months after I was born. The funny thing is that although I was born on the East Coast, I never actually went back until I was 17, when I competed in the nationals round for the Future Business Leaders of America competition in Baltimore, Maryland. My Pakistani background is definitely a very integral part of my identity, and I enjoy attending various cultural events to celebrate my heritage. I also really value the fact that my family identifies as Muslim, and I've involved myself in various activities at my local Mosque, where I help run charity events and take part in special celebrations.
